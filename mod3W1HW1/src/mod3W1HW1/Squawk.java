 //it did not like my set up and added another return called squaking...now it returns true. 
//
//We have a parrot that likes to squawk at night in its cage when itâ€™s scared. 
//Write a method named getUp that has 2 parameters
//1st parameter  should be a boolean and be named squawking it represent the parrot.
//2nd parameter represents the hour of the day and is an int named currentHour has a valid range of 0-23.
//We have to get up if the parrot is squawking before 6 or after 22 hours so in that case return true.
//All other cases will return false. 
//If the currentHour parameter is less than 0 or greater than 23 return false
